Strix The Realm is a configuration for the NT-RPG plugin by NeumimTo. Suggestions are welcome however this is mostly reserved for my personal server; which you are welcome to join :)

**Special Thanks**
Just wanted to give a special thanks to:
NeumimTo - For his awesome API NT-RPG/NT-Core i use to make all of this possible; and also for putting up with my stupid questions...
OnapleRPG - For your wonderful plugins Itemizer and Havester, and also for answering my dumb questions.
Random-Byte - For your plugins Command-Utils and ByteItems; And also for adding in a feature to Command-Utils to make my crafting system function.
